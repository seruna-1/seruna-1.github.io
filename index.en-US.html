			<p>Hello, my name is Mateus. I am a 18 years old guy that lives in Brazil and likes to understand computers and software. I would say I am an amateur programmer and enjoyer of science, in general. Yeah, I am a nerd.</p>

			<p>This is my personal website. Here, there is pretty much of anything.</p>

			<p>This hole domain is a <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> repository, hosted by <a href="https://codeberg.org/kalamado">Codeberg</a> and also by <a href="https://github.com/seruna-1">GitHub</a>. At these sites, you can access the source code of my site and of other projects of mine.</p>

			<p>I must admit, I begin more projects than I finish, but, maybe, you can find something interesting here.</p>

			<p>About this thing o showing something unfinished, it is cool to see something conceptual and clumsy getting shape as time passes.</p>

			<h1>Contact</h1>

			<p>If you want to contact me, you can send me an email. Here is my email adress</p>

			<h1>Misc</h1>

			<p><a href="coloured-thaissa/main.html">Coloured Thaissa</a> -- Page that shows characters of a text flashing, coloured. I made this when I still knew little about HTML, CSS e javascript. This would make a nice tutorial, right?</p>

			<p><a href="hanabi-css/readme.html">Hanabi CSS</a> -- A CSS and javascript framework that I develop for my domain. It was inspired by SimpleCSS and Sakura. I still have to work on documentation, but the codebase is not too complex, so you can use it in another project.</p>
