			<p>Hello, my name is Mateus. I am a 18 years old guy that lives in Brazil and likes to understand computers and software. I would say I am an amateur programmer and enjoyer of science, in general. Yeah, I am a nerd.</p>

			<p>This is my personal website. Here, there is pretty much of anything.</p>

			<p>
				<span>This hole domain is a</span>

				<a href="https://git-scm.com/"> git </a>

				<span> repository, hosted by</span>

				<a href="https://codeberg.org/kalamado">Codeberg</a>

				<span>and also by</span>

				<a href="https://github.com/seruna-1"> GitHub </a>

				<span>. At these sites, you can access the source code of my site and of other projects of mine.</span>

			</p>

			<p>I must admit, I begin more projects than I finish, but, maybe, you can find something interesting here.</p>

			<p>About this thing o showing something unfinished, it is cool to see something conceptual and clumsy getting shape as time passes.</p>

			<h1>Contact</h1>

			<p>If you want to contact me, you can send me an email. Here is my email adress</p>
