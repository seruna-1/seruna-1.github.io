[title] = [Mateus CezÃ¡rio Barreto]

[Hello, my name is Mateus. I am a 18 years old guy that lives in Brazil and likes to understand computers and software. I would say I am an amateur programmer and enjoyer of science, in general. Yeah, I am a nerd.]

[This is my personal website. Here, there is pretty much of anything.]

[This hole domain is a git repository, hosted by Codeberg and also by Github. At these sites, you can access the source code of my site and of other projects of mine.]

[I must admit, I begin more projects than I finish, but, maybe, you can find something interesting here.]

[About this thing o showing something unfinished, it is cool to see something conceptual and clumsy getting shape as time passes.]
